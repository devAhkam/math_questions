@title Area of a Composite Garden
@description Finding the area of a shape made from a rectangle and a semicircle.

@question A garden is shaped like a rectangle of length 12 m and width 8 m, with a semicircle of diameter 8 m attached to one of its shorter sides (as shown in the diagram below). What is the total area of the garden? (Use $\pi \approx 3.14$)

(A) $96 + 25.12$ m²
(B) $96 + 50.24$ m²
(C) $90 + 25.12$ m²
(D) $100 + 50.24$ m²
(E) $96 + 100.48$ m²

@instruction Choose the correct total area.

@option $96 + 25.12$ m²
@@option $96 + 25.12$ m²
@option $90 + 25.12$ m²
@option $100 + 50.24$ m²
@option $96 + 100.48$ m²

@explanation Area of rectangle = $12 \times 8 = 96$ m². Radius of semicircle = $\frac{8}{2} = 4$ m. Area of semicircle = $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = 0.5 \times 3.14 \times 16 = 25.12$ m². Total = $96 + 25.12 = 121.12$ m².
