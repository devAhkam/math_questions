@title Drawing Marbles from a Bag
@description Calculating probability of drawing certain colored marbles.

@question A bag contains 5 red marbles, 7 blue marbles, and 8 green marbles. If one marble is chosen at random, what is the probability that it is either red or green? Give your answer as a simplified fraction.

(A) $\frac{5}{20}$
(B) $\frac{13}{20}$
(C) $\frac{7}{20}$
(D) $\frac{8}{20}$
(E) $\frac{12}{20}$

@instruction Choose the correct probability.

@@option $\frac{13}{20}$
@option $\frac{7}{20}$
@option $\frac{8}{20}$
@option $\frac{12}{20}$

@explanation There are $5 + 7 + 8 = 20$ marbles in total. The number of favorable outcomes for red or green is $5 + 8 = 13$. Thus, the probability is $\frac{13}{20}$.
